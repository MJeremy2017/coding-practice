    "There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.\n",
    "Otherwise, it becomes vacant.\n",
    "(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.\n",
